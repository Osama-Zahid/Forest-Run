# Forest Run
Forest Run is a simple 2D side-scrolling game implemented in C++. The objective of the game is to run through a forest while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins. This is a 2 player game where the objective is to score as many points as possible and the player who scores the most points first wins the game.

# Usage
To play the game, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Compile the source code using a C++ compiler such as g++.
